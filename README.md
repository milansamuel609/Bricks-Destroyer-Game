# Bricks-Destroyer-Game
This is a game that I developed using the Phasor.io API.

Do the following steps by writing specific codes in the terminal in Visual Studio Code to run and play the game:- 

1) Write 'npm init' then press 'Enter' one by one after few installtion is done after that code.
2) Now install parcel a web server to run your game. To install it type 'npm install parcel-bundler' in the terminal.
3) Now to  finally run the game write 'npm run start'.
4) After writing that code you will get a server name 'local host'.
5) Copy that server link and paste it in a web browser to play the game.
6) Boom there you gooooo -> Now you can play the game.
